Project Title: University Student Management System
Description
A C++ application designed to manage student records, including academic performance, course enrollments, and attendance. The project incorporates a modular, object-oriented structure with role-based access for students, faculty, and administrators.

Features
Role-Based Access: Separate functionalities for students, faculty, and administrators.
Data Management: Stores and organizes student data efficiently with optimized search and sorting algorithms.
Data Persistence: Implements file handling to ensure data is saved for future access.
Predictive Analytics: Analyzes academic trends and generates insights for student improvement.
Error Handling: Ensures data accuracy and integrity through robust error-checking mechanisms.
Technologies Used
C++: Core programming language
Standard Template Library (STL): For data structures
File Handling: For data persistence
Predictive Analytics: For academic trend insights
CLI (Command Line Interface): For user interaction
Installation and Usage
Clone the repository.
Compile the code using a C++ compiler.
Run the executable to start the application, and follow the CLI prompts to interact with the system.
Current Progress
Currently implementing:

Optimized data retrieval and role-based access features
File handling for data storage and retrieval
Predictive analytics for academic performance insights
